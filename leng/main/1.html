			Artificial neural network - a mathematical model, as well as
			its software or hardware implementation, created by analogy 
			of the functioning of the biological neural network - a 
			network of nerve cells of a living organism. A characteristic 
			feature of neural networks is the globality of connections. 
			The basic elements of artificial neural networks are formal 
			neurons aimed at working with broadband information. Each 
			neuron of a network is usually interconnected with all 
			neurons of the previous layer (or even with all neurons). 
			This is a distinctive feature of formal neurons from the 
			basic elements of a computer - logic gates, which have only 
			two inputs and one output.
			<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
			An important means of protection against unauthorized access
			is the so-called intrusion Detection System (IDS). The 
			purpose of which is to identify and filter potentially
			harmful requests. One of the requirements for such systems
			is adaptability, i.e. the ability of the system to adapt to
			new types of attacks. The use of neural network technologies
			allows us to meet the requirement of adaptability to a
			certain extent.
			<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
			The aim of this work is to build a prototype of an attack
			detection system using direct propagation neural networks in
			combination with fuzzy neural networks. The advantage of
			this approach is the ability of such a system to generate a
			set of rules for classification.
