			Artificial neural network - a mathematical model, as well as
			its software or hardware implementation, created by analogy 
			of the functioning of the biological neural network - a 
			network of nerve cells of a living organism. A characteristic 
			feature of neural networks is the globality of connections. 
			The basic elements of artificial neural networks are formal 
			neurons aimed at working with broadband information. Each 
			neuron of a network is usually interconnected with all 
			neurons of the previous layer (or even with all neurons). 
			This is a distinctive feature of formal neurons from the 
			basic elements of a computer - logic gates, which have only 
			two inputs and one output.
